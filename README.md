This project based upon an Centralized Disaster Rescue Coordination Platform, is designed to
enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of disaster response efforts by providing a unified
platform for all rescue and relief agencies. This system addresses the critical need for real-time
coordination, secure communication, and optimized resource management during natural or
man-made disasters. By addressing the common challenges of fragmented information,
communication, breakdowns, and resource inefficiencies, this system aims to revolutionize
disaster response coordination, ultimately saving lives and reducing the impact of disasters on
affected communities.
